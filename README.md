# MCPrefixManager
This is my first basic plugin for Minecraft version 1.20.1 designed with Paper support in mind, It allows server owners to configure prefixes and the respective permissions to allow users access to these set prefixes and freely change between the ones they own. It is in a semi-functional form being dependent on GUI and other plugins to be used, however, you are free to use it on your server.

# Example Usage
Using an online storefront to give a user the permission node in-game, thus allowing them to use their purchased prefixes.
Preferably combine with an in-game GUI plugin to link the command to an action in said menu, always execute as the console.

# config.yml basic usage
Follow the provided template to add prefixes and their respective permissions.

This enables the usage of console command /changeprefixconfig [EXACT PREFIX STRING WITHOUT QUOTES AS IN CONFIG] [PLAYERUSERNAME] [PERMISSION NODE AS DENOTED IN CONFIG FILE]

This plugin is ideal if you use per-player prefixes that call for users to be able to switch between paid or acquired prefixes.

# Final notes

You are welcome to suggest any improvements or features and if you happen to find a noticeable bug and bring it to my attention, I will attempt to fix it.

If at any point you lose the config template, delete the config file and allow it to regenerate.
